Textupper:

I´ve been fascinated by photography since I got my first camera at the age of 14. I quickly realised that the ability to tell a story through a lens gives me the greatest sense of fulfilment. My images focus on a mix of raw emotions, documentary and fashion.

Films, artificial light and music are my inspiration and reflect my style. Also, I can't listen to music without constantly seeing images in my mind's eye.
